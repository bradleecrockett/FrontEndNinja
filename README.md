The goal of this assignment is to code the design mock shown and described in the slide deck.

1. Start by creating the appropriate links in ```index.html``` to the stylesheet and the ```bootstrap.css``` style sheet.
2. Add appropriate class names to each of the ```<div>```s so that the elements are the apropriate locations and sizes on the page.
3. Add the correct colors in ```style.css```
4. When your website matches the design mock, get it signed off by your teacher.
